# gmFoam
gmFoam is a integrated mesh conversion tool, which transforms original gmsh mesh (.msh file) partly into FEM (finite element method) mesh used for RealESSI and partly into FVM (finite volume method) mesh used for Openfoam. After that, we can simulate soil-structure-fluid interaction using RealEESI and Openfoam. 
Enjoy~
